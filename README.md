## Tooling Requirements

### Task

[Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) is a great shell commands bootstrap solution (like `Make` but in Yaml) permitting you to make the same calls locally (for development phases) and within the CI/CD pipeline.

You want to get familiar with it? Read [this](https://tsh.io/blog/taskfile-and-gnu-make-for-automation/).

You can install it that way:

```bash
asdf plugin add task
# Will install the Task version referenced in ./tool-versions
asdf install task $(asdf current task | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2)
task --version
```
